> [!NOTE]
> Any public repository under this profile licensed to Jim Philip, where the license year is out of date by **2 or more years**, may be regarded as **public domain**. This ensures that if a repository becomes inactive or abandoned, the code can still be fully open and usable by others.
>
> If the license year is later updated after the repository has entered the public domain, the repository will revert to its original license and can no longer be considered inactive or abandoned. However, any use or distribution of the code during the period it was considered public domain remains valid.

> **Example (in 2025):**
>
> - `Copyright (c) 2022-2024 Jim Philip` - _Not yet public domain (eligible in 2026)_
> - `Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Jim Philip` â€“ _Now public domain (license not updated for 2 years)_
