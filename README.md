> [!NOTE]
> Any public repository under this profile licensed to Jim Philip, where the license year is out of date by 2 or more years, may be regarded as public domain. This ensures that if a repository becomes inactive or abandoned, the code can still be fully open and usable by others.
>
> If the license year is later updated, the repository will no longer be considered public domain from that point forward, but any use or distribution that occurred while it was public domain remains valid. This policy resets with each update to the license.
>
> Example (in 2025):
>
> - `Copyright (c) 2022-2024 Jim Philip` - Not yet public domain (eligible in 2026)
> - `Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Jim Philip` â€“ Now public domain (license not updated for 2 years)
